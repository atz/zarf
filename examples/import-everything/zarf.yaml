# For demo purposes, the `required` key is set to false so we can deploy
# this package multiple times to showcase different features.

# This package showcases the following types of imports:
# - files (local and via HTTP)
# - charts (local and via OCI)
# - images (via a registry)
# - repos (via https:// or file://), git@ and ssh:// are also supported but not shown here
# - components (local and via OCI)

components:
  # Example of a prep component (this component currently does nothing)
  # Since this component is first in the list, it will be run first
  # and is a good area to put any pre-reqs / hooks for the other components
  - name: prep
    required: true
